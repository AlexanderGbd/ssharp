Probabilistic Tests  (Note: Always Release Mode):

Optimization 1: Probability Calculation with Transient Fault Optimization
1. no transient Fault Optimization (no Early Termination, MRMC, no Lumping, Jacobi, e=10^-6)
2. transient Fault Optimization (no Early Termination, MRMC, no Lumping, Jacobi, e=10^-6)
=> Following tests use Transient Fault Optimization



Optimization 2: Parallel generation of the Labeled Transition Markov Chain
3. 4 Cores (transient Fault Optimization, no Early Termination, MRMC, no Lumping, Jacobi, e=10^-6)
=> Following tests have 4 Cores activated by default


Optimization 3: Probability Calculation with Early Termination
7. with Early Termination (transient Fault Optimization, MRMC, no Lumping, Jacobi, e=10^-6)
8. with Early Termination (transient Fault Optimization, Built-In, no Lumping, Gauss-Seidel, 50 Iterations)
=> Following tests use Early Termination

Upcoming Optimization 4: Derive Hidden
Until now we assumed, we used optimized State Vectors. All State Vectors have been optimized manually. What happens, if we leave out this assumption
9. Probabilistic (transient Fault Optimization, with Early Termination, MRMC, no Lumping, Jacobi, e=10^-6)
10. Probabilistic (transient Fault Optimization, with Early Termination, Built-In, no Lumping, Gauss-Seidel, 50 Iterations)

Other Tests

11. DCCA (On the fly, Full Fault Optimization, Note maxCardinality:4 is used for a)
